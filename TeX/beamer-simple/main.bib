title = "The horseshoe estimator for sparse signals",
abstract = "This paper proposes a new approach to sparsity, called the
                  horseshoe estimator, which arises from a prior based
                  on multivariate-normal scale mixtures. We describe
                  the estimator's advantages over existing approaches,
                  including its robustness, adaptivity to different
                  sparsity patterns and analytical tractability. We
                  prove two theorems: one that characterizes the
                  horseshoe estimator's tail robustness and the other
                  that demonstrates a super-efficient rate of
                  convergence to the correct estimate of the sampling
                  density in sparse situations. Finally, using both
                  real and simulated data, we show that the horseshoe
                  estimator corresponds quite closely to the answers
                  obtained by Bayesian model averaging under a
                  point-mass mixture prior.",
